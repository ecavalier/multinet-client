# Contributing to Multinet

The Multinet platform is a big effort spread across several repositories, and it
represents just one software-based part of a larger research project. We are
excited to work with you to make the software better, solve your problems, and
run a top-notch research program.

Whether you're looking to use the software, file a bug report, contribute code
(either for a new feature or a bug fix), explore your own network data use
cases, or even just have a question, we are excited to work with you. You can
use the following resources to get involved.

## Bug/Issue Reports

If you run into any trouble with the software, you can open a report at one of
the issue trackers:

- [Multinet server issue tracker](https://github.com/multinet-app/multinet-server/issues)
- [Multinet client issue tracker](https://github.com/multinet-app/multinet-client/issues)
- [MultinetJS issue tracker](https://github.com/multinet-app/multinetjs/issues)

If you are not sure where a particular issue should be filed, you can use
whichever tracker feels the most related--we can always transfer it to a better
home if needed. Once you file an issue, we will do our best to respond to
questions and resolve any issues.

## Pull Requests

We also welcome code contributions sent via pull request. You should follow the usual
GitHub procedure of forking the repository, creating a topic branch to develop
your contribution, and opening a pull request against the original repository.

## Email

If you have general questions that aren't suitable for GitHub communications,
you can drop us a note at multinet@kitware.com. For example, if you want to know
more about the project, the software, and our goals for it, or you want to
collaborate with us because you have network data you'd like to have a better
way to analyze and visualize, then send us a message and we'll start a dialog.
